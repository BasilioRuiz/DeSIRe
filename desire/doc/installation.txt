   Steps for installing DeSIRe
---------------------------------

1) Copy "desire.tar" to the base directory where you want to install DeSIRe.
   The tar will create a folder named "desire" with everything you need.

   /home/user> cp desire.tar .

2) If you already have a "desire" directory (for instance, from a previous
   installation) it is better to remove it before the installation in order
   to delete any old obsolete file that may be not used. Extract the tar.

   home/user> rm -r desire
   home/user> tar xvf desire.tar

3) Now you have the directory tree created.
   /home/user/desire       : DeSIRe base directory
   /home/user/desire/bin   : executables
   /home/user/desire/doc   : documentation
   /home/user/desire/idl   : usefull IDL procedures
   /home/user/desire/run   : working directory
   /home/user/desire/src   : source code
   /home/user/desire/var   : application data files

4) Build the executables.

   home/user> cd desire/src
   home/user/desire/src> make install    (if ifort compiler)
   home/user/desire/src> make fc=gfortran install   (if gfortran compiler)

5) Run the example to check whether everything is OK.

   home/user/desire/src> cd ../run/example
   home/user/desire/run/example> ../../bin/desire desire.dtrol

6) For convenience, you can include the "bin" directory in your PATH.

7) Create as many working directories as you want within the "run" directory.
   It is a good practice that every working directory have an "input" folder
   with the input model files that DeSIRe needs (see "run/example").

8) Suggestion: to customize an inversion create a new subdirectory within
   the "run" directory and copy to it "desire.dtrol", "keyword.input" as well
   as the "input" folder included in "run/example". Then you can modify them
   to your personal case.
